Short Introduction About DeskWidgets

Thats all about ElahiNexusTech, now about our First Product named DeskWidgets. So this application is initially developed by myself and hosted from ElahiNexusTech (its not hosted right now), We will be releasing this Application's BETA Version on December 31, 2023 on Sunday (NO TIME IS SPECIFIED). As we all know BETA versions are versions of the application for the testing of the application on different devices and architectures, and they showed a blured image what the actual Application (STABLE VERSIONS) will look like, anyways the BETA version 1.0.0.0 will be having some bugs and bugs running on their own system and architecture. The stable version of the Application will be Announced in January 2024 or it can be delayed to February 2024. But between this whole time new releases or minor bug fixes will be done almost regularly (Inshallah).



Features and Application Build Enviroment/Architecutre

The application for now only provides a Clock Widget, but in future updates there will be more widgets with more customizeable options i.e. Fonts, Backgrounds, Transparency Effect and much more. In the January Updates there will be one/two new widgets add in the Application it self. 

The build enviroment for this software is set to x64 Bit Processor, NOTE they are not build on the ARM Based CPU Architecture or PoC Architecture but still be working on thoose Systems too. 

Application Images and Coding Enviroment

This screen shot was captured on my device running macOS Monterey (Dont See the Wallpapers I love Ventura's Wallpapers thats why I have set it other wise its running OS 12), the application works fine on this machine. The Application is coded on Python and its frameworks like tkinter and more. These Frameworks will automatically installed on users system when they install the application.
